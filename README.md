# Hands-Free AWS Instance Creation with AI

Welcome to the Hands-Free AWS Instance Creation with AI project! This innovative project combines AWS, AI, and web technologies to allow you to provision AWS instances using a simple finger gesture captured in a video. Say goodbye to manual inputs and hello to the future of cloud resource provisioning!

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a unique approach to AWS instance creation by leveraging AI-powered image recognition. Users can record a video of a specific finger gesture, and the AI model will identify the gesture's intent and trigger the creation of an AWS instance accordingly.

## Features

- **Gesture-Driven:** Provision AWS instances by showing a specific finger gesture in a video.
- **AI Recognition:** Utilizes AI algorithms to analyze videos and identify meaningful gestures.
- **Dynamic User Interface:** Intuitive web interface built with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for user interaction.
- **Efficient Cloud Resource Provisioning:** Eliminates manual input and streamlines instance creation.
- **Scalable AWS Infrastructure:** Built on the robust foundation of AWS, ensuring reliability and scalability.
